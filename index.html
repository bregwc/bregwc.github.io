<p>Bio:I am a girl who code and will be in the 12th grade in the fall.
One of my interest is dance. I like to dance because dance can express who u are in many ways.
To me, the gift of dance is having the opportunity to be able to pursue expression and beauty through movement and imagination.
Also, to be surrounded by people on and off the stage who are also 'transported' by dance.‚Äù</p>

<p>What Is Dance: Dance is the hidden language of the soul. There are so many different types of styles that you can do.
Some different types of styles are hip hop, jazz, tap, ballet and many more. I t's a way for me to express myself, a way for me to relieve stress,
a way for me to share the gift that God has given me, and just a way for me to have fun! ...
dance gives me so many opportunities, but at the same time it also takes away from having a regular life.</p>
